# Staff Scheduling Optimization

The Staff Scheduling Optimization application is designed to assist in scheduling employees based on various factors, such as availability, shift requirements, and costs. The tool
provides an interface for inputting data like the number of employees, shifts, and days,
as well as constraints such as maximum shifts per employee. The goal is to minimize the
total cost of scheduling while meeting all operational requirements.
